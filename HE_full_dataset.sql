-- step 1. Find adults between ages 15 and 89.
-- step 2. Create chartevents table with only adults.
-- step 3. Update table to include patients from icu. This includes MICU, SICU, CCU, CSRU.
-- step 4. Query chartevents_adults for patients that have expierenced a hypotensive episode. 
-- step 5. Remove Patients that are coded with comfort measures only (CMO).
-- step 6. Find Patients pre-serum creatinine and post-serum creatinine values.
-- step 7. Obtain Patients that recieved Fluids treatment.
-- step 8. Repeat step 7 for patients given vasopressors.
-- step 9. Consolidate steps 7 and 8 into 1 table.
-- step 10. Get mean MAP and total urine output for 4 hours previous to onset of HE.
-- step 11. Obtain Age, gender, los, and service type (ICU).
